                <h2 class="section-title">Here's what most companies don't understand:</h2>
                <p class="section-subtitle">It's not a product problem. It's a trust problem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="failure-grid">
                <div class="failure-card">
                    <div class="failure-number">01</div>
                    <h3>Your customers can't tell the difference</h3>
                    <p>Modern counterfeiters don't make obvious fakes anymore.</p>
                    <p>They clone your packaging. They copy your holograms. They replicate your QR codes. Some fakes are so good that even your own employees can't spot them.</p>
                    <p><strong>By the time a customer realizes they bought a fake, the damage is done.</strong></p>
                    <p>Your brand takes the hit. Not the counterfeiters.</p>
                    <div class="failure-example">
                        <strong>Real Example:</strong> In 2022, a luxury watch brand discovered that 73% of "authenticated" products on secondary markets were sophisticated counterfeits. Their customers had no idea.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="failure-card">
                    <div class="failure-number">02</div>
                    <h3>Traditional verification is broken</h3>
                    <p><strong>QR codes?</strong> Copied in minutes. Counterfeiters just photograph the real code and print it on fakes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Holograms?</strong> Counterfeited at scale. For $0.12 per unit, you can buy hologram stickers that look identical to yours.</p>
                    <p><strong>Serial numbers?</strong> Databases get hacked. Or counterfeiters just use real serial numbers from legitimate products.</p>
                    <p><strong>RFID tags?</strong> Cloned. The encryption is weak and the chips are cheap.</p>
                    <p>You need cryptographic proof—not easily-cloned stickers.</p>
                    <div class="failure-example">
                        <strong>Real Example:</strong> A pharmaceutical company spent $50M on holographic packaging. Within 6 months, counterfeiters were producing identical holograms for $0.08 each.
                    </div>

                <div class="failure-card">
                    <div class="failure-number">03</div>
                    <h3>Privacy is non-negotiable</h3>
                    <p>Your customers don't want to create accounts. They don't want to share their email. They definitely don't want to register their purchases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Regulators won't let you collect it.</strong></p>
                    <p>GDPR in Europe. CCPA in California. PIPL in China. The regulatory landscape is moving toward privacy-first, not privacy-optional.</p>
                    <p>Any solution that requires product registration is dead on arrival.</p>
                    <p>You can't verify authenticity by building a database of who bought what. That's not just bad UX—it's a legal liability.</p>
                    <div class="failure-example">
                        <strong>Real Example:</strong> A consumer electronics brand tried mandatory product registration. 94% of customers never registered. The "authentication" system verified nothing.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="failure-card">
                    <div class="failure-number">04</div>
                    <h3>The liability is all yours</h3>
                    <p>When a counterfeit product fails, regulators don't go after the factory in Shenzhen.</p>
                    <p>They go after <strong>you</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Your insurance. Your executives. Your shareholders.</p>
                    <p>Because in the eyes of the law, if it has your brand on it, <strong>you're responsible</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Product liability lawsuits average $2.7M. Class actions? $50M+. Regulatory fines? Unlimited.</p>
                    <p>And that's before the brand damage. Before the recall costs. Before customers stop trusting you.</p>
                    <div class="failure-example">
                        <strong>Real Example:</strong> An automotive parts manufacturer faced a $180M class action lawsuit because counterfeit brake pads (with their logo) caused multiple accidents. They didn't make the fakes. They paid anyway.
